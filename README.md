# 🎧 SpotifyDB — End-to-End SQL Portfolio Project

## 📌 Project Overview
**SpotifyDB** is a comprehensive, real-world inspired SQL portfolio project that simulates the backend database of a music streaming platform like **Spotify**.

This project is designed to **demonstrate complete SQL mastery**, covering everything from **schema design and data manipulation** to **advanced analytics, performance optimization, security, and database engineering concepts**.

It is built in **phases**, each representing a higher level of SQL proficiency — from foundational querying to production-level database features.

> 🎯 Purpose: Showcase job-ready SQL skills for **Data Analyst, Backend Developer, BI, and SQL Developer roles**

## 🏗️ Database Domain
The database models a full music-streaming ecosystem, including:

- Users & subscriptions  
- Artists, albums, tracks & genres  
- Playlists & listening history  
- Advertisements & revenue  
- Devices & user activity  
- Concerts & ticketing  
- Reviews, analytics & audits  

The schema follows **normalized relational design** with realistic business rules.
